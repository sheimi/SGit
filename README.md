## Quick start

### Clone a remote repository

1. Click on the *+* icon to add a new repository.
2. Enter remote URL (see URL format below).
3. Enter local repository name - note that this is not a path since Forker stores all repositories in the same directory on the mobile device.
4. Username - username to use to clone the remote repo.
5. Password - password to use to clone the remote repo.
6. Click the *Clone* button.
7. If all the credentials are correct, Forker will download the repository (all branches) to your device.

### Create a local repository
1. Click on the *+* icon to add a new repository.
2. Click on *Init Local* to create a local repository.
3. Enter the name for this repository when prompted.
4. A local repo will be created.

### URL format

#### SSH URLs

 * SSH running on standard port (22): `ssh://username@server_name/path/to/repo`
* SSH running on non-standard port: `ssh://username@server_name:port/path/to/repo`
* `username` is needed - by default, Forker tries to connect as root.

#### HTTP(S) URLs

* HTTP(S) URL: `https://server_name/path/to/repo`

## To Do List

 * Private key passphrase
 * Commits related to a file
 * Commit graph (low priority)
